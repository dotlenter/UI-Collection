## Notes

Running on CLI (if ever): `flutter run -t lib/main_<variant>.dart --flavor <variant>;`

**ARCHITECTURE** â€“ functional. Only domain can access both the page and data. Page cannot access data and vice-versa

**TASK**: Schedule

**TODO**: domain and page

Page: fetch schedule on load

To fetch, you need bloc or schedule bloc

On bloc: mock a loading state using Future.delayed(duration)

You initialize your fake data afterwards into entities

That is what you pass onto the page/UI

    Note: Enzo will be creating the contents of schedule_state.dart but that's only for comparison

    In bloc, you are calling an event that returns a state
